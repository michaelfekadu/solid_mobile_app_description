        Osteoarthritis is a condition in which excessive bone growth occurs in
        the knee, leading to pain and discomfort. To assist in the surgical
        treatment of this condition, Stryker has developed the MAKO robot, a
        robotic surgical assistant. In addition to the robot, Stryker also
        created a website to provide a centralized platform for pre-surgical
        preparation.

        Our goal was to make the surgical experience more convenient and
        accessible for users. To achieve this, we created a mobile app to access
        and view confidential medical information. The app offers many of the
        important features found on the website, making it easier for surgeons
        to manage their surgical procedures efficiently.
