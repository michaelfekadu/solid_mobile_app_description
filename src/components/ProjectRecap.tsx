        During this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of app
        development with React Native. I also achieved proficiency in working
        with REST APIs, gained knowledge of app authentication, deepened my
        JavaScript expertise, and became familiar with testing frameworks such
        as Detox and Appium. Furthermore, I learned how to publish and update
        apps on the Apple App Store. I am grateful to my team at Stryker for
        providing me with this invaluable learning experience and the
        opportunity to broaden my skill set.
