        During this project, I gained a deep understanding of app development
        with React Native. I also gained proficiency in working with APIs,
        learned the fundamentals of authentication, refreshed my skills in
        JavaScript, and became familiar with testing frameworks such as Detox
        and Appium. Additionally, I learned how to publish and update apps on
        the Apple App Store. I am grateful to my team at Stryker for providing
        me with this valuable learning experience and the opportunity to expand
        my skill set.
